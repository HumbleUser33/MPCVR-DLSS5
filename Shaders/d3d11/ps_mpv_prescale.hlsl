// The passes around the mpv prescalers (Shaders/mpv), which enlarge one plane:
// the renderer hands them that plane and puts the colour back itself.
//
//   PASS 1  luma of the picture, for FSRCNNX and RAVU-zoom
//   PASS 2  colour: the picture enlarged by Catmull-Rom (t0) with its luma
//           replaced by the prescaler's (t1), both at the same size. The
//           difference goes to R, G and B alike, which moves luma and leaves
//           B - Y and R - Y as they were, whatever weights the luma has.
//   PASS 3  one channel of a chroma plane (the constant picks it) into red, for
//           a prescaler on Cb and on Cr
//   PASS 4  pass 2 with anti-ringing: before the luma goes in, it is held to the
//           range the source plane (t2) really covers around that point, which is
//           what libplacebo does inside its own kernels. A network invents an edge
//           steeper than the one it was given; this takes back the overshoot.
//   PASS 5  anti-ringing alone, on a plane a prescaler enlarged (t0) against the
//           plane it was given (t1): for chroma, which has no colour to put back.
//
// They all draw through the renderer's quad and read with its point sampler,
// output and input sizes matching texel for texel, except where a pass reads the
// smaller plane it started from.
